## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Flutter installed on your machine. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Once you have Flutter installed, you can clone this repository and run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will start the app in debug mode. If you want to build the app for release, you can run the following command:

```bash
flutter build <platform>
```

Replace `<platform>` with the platform you want to build for. For example, if you want to build for Windows, you would run:

```bash
flutter build windows
```
